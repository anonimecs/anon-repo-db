anon-repo-db
============

The enterprise version of anonimecs requires an external database to persist its setup. Check out this project and run the _startDerby.bat_ or _startDerby.sh_ start script to start an derby based configuration database.

You can then build and start the enterprise version, that will connect to this database.
